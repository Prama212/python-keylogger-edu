## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to build a basic keylogger in Python using the `pynput` library
- Working with virtual environments (`venv`) in Kali Linux
- Using system-wide key listeners and logging user input securely
- Writing clean and organized code with proper documentation
- Managing `.gitignore` to keep unnecessary files out of the repository
- Uploading and maintaining a GitHub project for public portfolio use
- Understanding the importance of ethical boundaries in cybersecurity
  
## 💡 Why I Built This

As an aspiring cybersecurity student, I wanted to start by building a small but impactful project. This keylogger was developed in a controlled virtual environment to better understand how input logging works — and how to defend against it. This project also helped me explore ethical boundaries in cybersecurity.
